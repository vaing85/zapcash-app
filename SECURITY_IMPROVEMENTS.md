# Security Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements made to the ZapPay application based on the security audit recommendations.

## âœ… Completed Security Improvements

### 1. Environment Variable Logging Security
**Issue**: Environment variables were being logged in production, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `backend/server.js` to only log environment variable status in development mode
- Production mode now shows a generic "security logging disabled" message
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive configuration details

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` (lines 451-460)

### 2. Database SSL Configuration Enhancement
**Issue**: Database SSL configuration was using `rejectUnauthorized: false` by default, which could allow man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Solution**:
- Updated `backend/config/database.js` to use `rejectUnauthorized: true` by default
- Added environment variable `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to allow override when needed
- Implemented automatic certificate usage when available
- Added comprehensive SSL configuration options

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/config/database.js` (lines 23-33, 52-63)
- `backend/env.example` (added SSL configuration section)

**New Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Database SSL Configuration (Optional - for enhanced security)
# DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true  # Set to false only for self-signed certificates
# DB_CA_CERT=your_ca_certificate
# DB_CLIENT_CERT=your_client_certificate  
# DB_CLIENT_KEY=your_client_key
```

### 3. Granular Rate Limiting Implementation
**Issue**: Single rate limiting policy applied to all endpoints, not optimized for different endpoint types.

**Solution**:
- Created `backend/middleware/rateLimiting.js` with specialized rate limiters:
  - **General API**: 200 requests per 15 minutes
  - **Authentication**: 10 attempts per 15 minutes (login/register)
  - **Payment**: 20 requests per 15 minutes
  - **Webhooks**: 100 requests per minute (for external services)
  - **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour
  - **Admin**: 50 requests per 15 minutes

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/middleware/rateLimiting.js` (new file)
- `backend/server.js` (updated to use granular rate limiting)
- `backend/routes/auth.js` (added auth and password reset rate limiting)
- `backend/routes/payments.js` (added payment rate limiting)
- `backend/routes/webhooks.js` (added webhook rate limiting)
- `backend/env.example` (updated rate limiting configuration)

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Information Disclosure**
- Environment variable logging disabled in production
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive configuration

### 2. **Enhanced Database Security**
- SSL certificate validation enabled by default
- Configurable SSL settings for different deployment scenarios
- Better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

### 3. **Improved Attack Prevention**
- Granular rate limiting prevents brute force attacks on auth endpoints
- Payment endpoints protected against abuse
- Password reset attempts limited to prevent enumeration attacks
- Webhook endpoints optimized for external service requirements

## Configuration Guide

### Database SSL Setup
For maximum security, configure SSL certificates:

```bash
# Set these environment variables
DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true
DB_CA_CERT=your_ca_certificate_content
DB_CLIENT_CERT=your_client_certificate_content
DB_CLIENT_KEY=your_client_key_content
```

### Rate Limiting Customization
Rate limits can be customized by modifying the values in `backend/middleware/rateLimiting.js`:

```javascript
// Example: Increase payment rate limit
const paymentLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 50, // 50 payment requests per window (increased from 20)
  // ... other options
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test SSL Configuration**: Verify database connections work with SSL enabled
2. **Test Rate Limiting**: Verify different endpoints respect their rate limits
3. **Test Production Logging**: Confirm environment variables are not logged in production
4. **Load Testing**: Ensure rate limits don't impact legitimate usage

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure security improvements are working:

1. **Rate Limit Hits**: Track when rate limits are triggered
2. **Database SSL Errors**: Monitor for SSL connection issues
3. **Authentication Failures**: Track failed login attempts
4. **Payment Request Patterns**: Monitor for unusual payment activity

## Conclusion

These security improvements significantly enhance the overall security posture of the ZapPay application while maintaining functionality and performance. The changes are backward-compatible and can be deployed without affecting existing users.
