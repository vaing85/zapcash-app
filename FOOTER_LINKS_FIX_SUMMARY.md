# Footer Links Fix - Progress Summary

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**
Fixed broken footer links in the main dashboard that were not navigating to correct pages or showing proper content.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
1. **Missing SubscriptionProvider**: The `useSubscription` hook was being used in pages but the `SubscriptionProvider` was not included in the provider chain, causing React context errors.
2. **Broken mailto links**: Footer links for "Help Center", "Business Inquiries", and "Privacy Inquiries" were using `mailto:` links which were unreliable.

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. Fixed SubscriptionProvider Context Error
- **File**: `src/components/AppProviders.tsx`
- **Fix**: Added `SubscriptionProvider` to the provider chain
- **Impact**: Resolved "useSubscription must be used within a SubscriptionProvider" error
- **Pages Fixed**: DeveloperDashboard, APIDocumentation, and other pages using useSubscription

### 2. Created Dedicated Pages for Footer Links
- **Help Center** (`/help-center`)
  - Comprehensive FAQ with search functionality
  - Support contact options
  - System status indicators

### 3. Updated Footer Links
- **File**: `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `mailto:` links with React Router `Link` components
- **Routes**: Added proper routing in `src/App.tsx`
